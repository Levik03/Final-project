                <div><img class="week2" src="img/week2.png"><br>WEEK 2 <br>This worksheet was mainly just on about the placement on the content inside your html and it started off by adding the title for the website. 
                    <br>This then lead to a filling out the body section of the html and it started with adding headings and paragraphs. 
                    <br>This is where the bulk of the content will come from. 
                    <br>It then went on to adding ordered and unordered lists, and then went on to explain the paragraph tags and how to properly add emphasis to it if you needed. 
                    <br>After this It precedes to explain how to add a hyperlink and then finally finishes by inserting an image into the html.
                </div>
                <div><img class="week3" src="img/week3.png"><br>WEEK 3 <br>This weeks worksheet is on about styling all the content that was added to the html in the last worksheet and it starts of by showing how to add the style sheet link onto the html page which is important as if it wasn’t included the html pages wouldn’t get styled. 
                    <br>It then goes onto about styling the background of the body of the html. 
                    <br>Next was the headings which were changed by adding a font family to them. 
                    <br>It then shows us about how to style classes and how to style individual elements. 
                    <br>Then is leads to showing how to store all images that are going on the website.

            <h3>WEEK 4, WEEK 5</h3>
            <div class="weekContainer">
                <div><img class="week4" src="img/week4.png"><br>WEEK 4</div>
                <div><img class="week5" src="img/week5.png"><br>WEEK 5</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>in these worksheets it showed how to properly used flex boxes and how to get everything to flex and adjust when the size of the screen changes.
            The week 4 worksheet showed how to split certain things of into relevant sections which helps neaten up the page so everything is all boxed up in one space.
            it also shows who to link and import a font from adobe and google fonts. This is good as it allows for more personalisation and makes the whole thing stand out much more. 
            week 5 showed how to add a hover colour over the buttons and colour change and shadow when pressed. 
            These weekly worksheets did help me to understand more about the layout of the html websites and helped me improve the build of my website. 
             These tasks did make the build of my website easier as they clearly displayed the information to learn and alowed me to take the design a step further.

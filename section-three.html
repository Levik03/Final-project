                <div class="typecontent">AXIAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM <br>An axial typographic system is where everything is divided by an imaginary axis 
                    and all of the content on it can be running along matching to that same axis or perpendicular to it. The content on either side of 
                    the axis can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. This can also have in other elements such as shapes like rectangles and this 
                    could be done to make the design more visually appealing and can bring attention to other things on the design and balance the page out.

                <div class="typecontent2">DILATATIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM <br>A dilatational typographic system has all of the content and elements expand from a 
                    central point in a circular way like the rings on a tree expand outwards. This system is suited for small sections of text and posters as when a 
                    longer script of text the words will go fully around the circle and be harder to read as so will be upside down. You can use circles to type on a 
                    path to get the curved transformation and by varying to size and the centre point of them allows for a nice fluid motion effect.

                <div class="typecontent3">BILATERAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM <br>A bilateral typographic system is based on mirrored symmetry but can be made asymmetrical as 
                    this can make them look more visually appealing as just straight and centred may look simple and boring. By using simple shapes to the design can 
                    highlight the layers in the design and can add emphasis to certain elements on the page. A good way to split stings up from the centre would be to 
                    split the content into blocks and put them on their own axis and tilt.

                <div class="typography"><img id="type4" src="img/Typographic systems-04.png" alt="grid"
                    onmouseover="type4_mouseover()" onmouseout="type4_mouseout()"></div>
                <div class="typecontent">GRID TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM <br>A grid typographic system put the text first and by doing this it is very easy to understand the 
                    readability of it and works well on posters as with this system the text, elements and graphics fit clearly in rows and columns, and by merging some 
                    of these together creates visual fields that are of different shape and sizes which make it more visually appealing as its not just symmetrical and centred.

                    onmouseover="type5_mouseover()" onmouseout="type5_mouseout()"></div>
                <div class="typecontent2">RADIAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM <br>A radial typographic system has its content and elements organised so that they extends/ radiates outwards 
                    from a centre point like rays from the sun. This system has dynamics compositions as the viewers' attention is drawn to the main focal point that is the radial 
                    composition. The radial system allows for a whole lot of flexibility for the design as you can adjust the depth of each line or line content up on different edges 
                    and other circles. By adding different shapes it can bring attention to the balance of the design.

                    onmouseover="type6_mouseover()" onmouseout="type6_mouseout()"></div>
                <div class="typecontent3">MODULAR TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM <br>A modular typographic system is when there is a repeated structure that allows for the information of the content 
                    to be broken up throughout the page and it is quite similar to the grid typographic system. This system is lots of small compositions that can come together to create 
                    larger compositions.  This works well for posters that list multiple different things as it neatly splits up information so its easy to read.

                    onmouseover="type7_mouseover()" onmouseout="type7_mouseout()"></div>
                <div class="typecontent">RANDOM TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM <br>A random typographic system has all of its content and elements organised randomly which means placed without solid 
                    aim, purpose, direction, rule, pattern or method. This allows for the system to have a dynamic composition. This can be done by placing many different elements such as 
                    shapes, text, and transforming the content like rotation or opacity level within the page and this causes it to have a graffiti sort of feel and look towards it.

                <div class="typecontent2">TRANSITIONAL TYPOGRAPHIC SYSTEM <br>A transitional typographic system is a system of layered lines of text that doesnâ€™t have any interrelationships 
                    between an axis or edges and the elements move freely. It can be made to look like flowing water and waves transitioning over other elements on the page. This movement can 
                    be captured by implying that the text is sliding into place and can be shown with shapes and angles like its climbing up a path.

            <p>During this project there was many new things that I have learnt, other things where I found better ways of doing than I originally knew and many things that I wish I did and would do differently If I was to do this again. 
                <br>One of the new things that I have learnt from doing this project would be that my skills in using InDesign have gotten much better as at the start of making the carp posters the first poster design that I had made was a lot more simple and basic compared to the later ones that I made as the first one I had not used many of the tools that where available to me but nearer the end my understanding of what carp is and the tools to use the quality of poster gradually improved. 
                <br>Another thing that I have learnt from this project is from the typography work as I learnt how to transform the text such as typing on a path, and this was good as I then later was able to use that tool on the carp project which greatly improved my poster design.
                <br>One thing that I found better ways of doing was that when coding the website commenting on the code made it easier to read on what was where and as it showed clearly what related things that I could keep together.
                <br>One thing that I wish I did and would do if I were to do this again would be to have more of a starting plan such as making a wireframe for the design of my website as I would have been able to actually see what the website might have looked like which would have made it easier to make. 
                <br>Another thing that I would do differently is I would have used more typographic systems within my carp poster designs, I would have done this because they draw attention the page more and add a certain feel to what they are used on. 
                <br>One more thing that I would do in the future would be to practice using the design applications such as InDesign before I start making the posters as I didn’t know how to use when making my first poster and it wasn’t as good as the later ones I made.

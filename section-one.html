                <div id="p1"><img id="poster1" src="img/Poster1.png" alt="poster1"><br>This is poster design 1 <br>Contrast has been used on this poster by using a light blue as the main background and a light orange as the secondary colour this creates contrast on the poster as they are complementary colours.
                    The use of alinement on the poster is done by having the content split up in sections of information that is relevant with each other.
                    <br>The alignment of the skateboarding pictures Is in the centre of the poster, and this clearly shows the viewer that it is aimed at girls. The logo is aligned at the top of the poster, and this clearly shows us who they are and what it is that they do.
                    <br>Proximity is achieved as the text is separated from each other by white space. This is done as it makes the information on the poster easier to read 
                    <br>One thing that could have been done more was that there isn’t the use of much repetition on any of the elements on the poster. I could have added repetition by repeating the placement of some of the images and shapes, there is a repeating element of the colours of the text as if there where multiple it would be overwhelming to look at on the poster.
                </div>

                <div id="p2"><img id="poster2" src="img/Poster2.png" alt="poster2"><br>This is poster design 2 <br>The contrast is achieved on this poster is by the white colour of the text on the black background. This makes the whole poster catch the eye and gives it a chalkboard look to it. It is also done 
                    by having coloured images layered on a white outlined version of the images. This make the images stand out more as it has a shadow and gives the poster some depth. Another bit of contrast on this would be the bright colours on the important pieces of the information this is done as it highlights it out of the black background catching the eye.
                    <br>The alignment of the brand name and the event that is taking place Is that it is at the top of the poster, this makes it clear on what it is about. It is also at an angle, and this adds some asymmetry to the poster.
                    <br>The proximity on this is shows that all the active dates that this event takes place are all right next to each other as if they weren’t it wouldn’t be clear on when.
                    <br>One thing that could have been added/done better would be the repetition of some elements of the poster as the only repeating element is the white text over the whole poster.
                </div>

                <div id="p3"><img id="poster4" src="img/Poster4.png" alt="poster4"><br>This is poster design 3 <br>The contrast on this poster is shown with the cream background against the solid black logo of the brand background. Another way would be that of the text of the content against the background as 
                    this makes the text stand out on the poster.
                    <br>The alignment of the text content as the more important information is in the centre of the poster around the main subject that will catch the viewers eyes first. All the text is also aligned by how relevant they are with each other.
                    <br>The repetition of the black logo in the back of the whole poster suits with the theme of skateboarding as it gives a graffiti like feeling. This also fully shows the brand across the poster.
                    <br>The proximity of the text is laid out so that the information doesn’t make the poster look crowded and this is done by having white space between each section.

            <div class="posterContainer">
                <div id="p4"><img class="poster3" src="img/Poster3.png" alt="poster3"><br>This is the main design for the Girls skate clinic poster <br>The contrast on this poster is done by having the elements of the  poster be layered on a full image instead of on a single-coloured background. 
                    This gives contrast as it gives depth to the poster, and it shows the theme of what the clinic is. Another way contrast is made would be how the logo is layered behind the main subject but still Infront of the skate park landscape.
                    <br>The alignment of the important content is right  in the centre of the poster to make sure that the viewers of the poster can see it. The alignment of the other text is at an angle 
                    <br>The repetition on this is that the colours of the logo are repeated on all the text on the poster. this keeps the poster looking organised and not messy as it isn’t using a lot of colours. Another way repetition is used in this would be the font is repeated throughout the poster.
                    With the poster being landscape it makes the poster seem like there is more blank space between the different  blocks of information and them being apart from each other allows for them be read easier as it is clear what is in each section.
                    <br>One thing that I could have done to improve this poster would be by adding more repeating elements of content as it would make it more visually recognisable
